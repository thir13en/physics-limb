# Waves


### Cycle
The time it takes for a recurrent wave to be exactly in the same state (position and momentum). Defines the wavelength.

### Frequency
The amount of cycles per second. Related to `pitch` in sound waves.

### Amplitude
The intensity of the wave defined by the y-axis oscillation.

### Harmonic waves
The frequency of these is a perfect multiple.
