# Electronics

The phisics of electrons and it's utilities to store and transmit information.

### DC/AC
Continuous current / Alternate Current

### Intensity
Measured in Amperes, electric load that passes a wire in a unit of time.

### Voltage
Measured in Volts. Refers to electronic potential or differential load between two related components of a circuit.

### Resistance
Measures the opposing force towards a current flux.

### Ohm Law
Establishes that the current that passes through a circuit is directly proporcional to the potential diferential between extrems and inversely proportional to the resistances present in the circuit.
```
I = V/R
```

### Components
#### Resistances
Oppose the passing current.

#### Variable Resistances
Oppose the passing current with variable opposing force.

#### Condensers
Temporarily store electric loads

#### Diode
Allow the circulation of current in an only direction

#### Light Diode
Emits light when traversed by electricity.

#### Transistor
Sandwitch inbetween semi-conductor layers of opposied sign: Positive and Negative.

#### Rele
Electric switch activated by the means of an electro-magnet.

#### Integrated Circuit
A mixture of componets that achieve an end.

#### PCB (Printed Circuit Board)
A type of Integrated Circuit designed to create complex architectures via silicon printing.
